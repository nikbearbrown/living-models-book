I want you to sit with a problem before I teach you anything.

You have a 500-page corporate policy manual. A user asks, *what's our parental leave policy for adoptive parents in California?* You have two reasonable ways to answer this with a large language model.

The first option is to feed the entire 500-page manual into the model's context window. The model reads everything, finds the relevant section, and answers. Modern models can do this — Gemini and Claude now accept a million tokens or more. One call, one answer. No infrastructure beyond the API.

The second option is to pre-process the manual into small chunks. Convert each chunk into a vector. Store the vectors in a database. When the user asks, convert the question into a vector, retrieve the most relevant five or ten chunks, paste those into a much smaller context window, and ask the model to answer.

The second option is Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is more complex, requires more infrastructure, adds a failure mode (what if retrieval misses the relevant chunk?), and is architecturally less elegant than *just feed the model everything.*

And yet every serious production system I have looked at in the last three years uses some version of the second option. Why?

I have watched teams spend six months building RAG pipelines when long-context would have shipped in two weeks. I have also watched teams burn through their API budget in a week because they stuffed a million tokens into every query. Both mistakes come from not understanding the machinery. The question is not *is RAG better than long-context?* The question is *under what conditions does each win, and how do I tell which regime I'm in?*

This chapter answers that.

## The System That Couldn't Find Its Own Answer

In the spring of 2024, a team of graduate students built what looked, on the surface, like a reasonable thing. Their research group had accumulated four years of internal lab reports — about 340 documents, totaling roughly 180,000 words — and they wanted a system that could answer questions about methodology, experimental results, and equipment settings. They built the pipeline in a weekend: chunk the documents, embed the chunks, store the vectors in a database, retrieve the top-k at query time, feed the retrieved context to the model.

The system produced confident, fluent answers. It also, on roughly one query in four, produced answers that were wrong — not hallucinated, but mislocated. It was confusing centrifuge settings from one protocol version with another because a retrieval step had pulled the wrong chunk, and the model had no way to know.

The failure was quiet. No stack traces. No runtime errors. HTTP 200 and a well-formatted string. The wrongness was invisible until someone checked the answer by hand.

The deepest irony: the entire corpus — 180,000 words — would have fit inside a single call to a contemporary large language model. The team had spent a weekend building infrastructure that made their answers worse.

**The question this chapter answers:** Given a corpus of documents, a set of queries, and a model with a finite context window, what is the right architecture — and what does it cost you to choose the wrong one?

---

## Six Stages

Before the decision, the architecture itself.

<!-- → [INFOGRAPHIC: RAG pipeline flow — six sequential stages labeled left to right: Ingest → Chunk → Embed → Store → Retrieve & Rerank → Generate; each stage annotated with key design decision (e.g. "~500 tokens, 50-token overlap" at Chunk; "ANN search" at Retrieve); student should see the shift from indexing-time cost to query-time cost] -->

Raw documents get *ingested* — PDFs, Markdown, HTML, database rows. Just collection, nothing intelligent yet. They get *chunked* into roughly 500-token segments with 50 to 100 tokens of overlap at boundaries. Each chunk gets *embedded* — converted into a 1,024- to 3,072-dimensional vector, where semantic similarity corresponds to geometric proximity. Vectors get *stored* in a vector database that supports approximate nearest-neighbor search. At query time, *retrieval and reranking* return the top five or ten most relevant chunks — a fast first stage narrows a million chunks to a hundred, then a slower second stage narrows the hundred to ten. Finally, those chunks get formatted into a prompt with the user's question, and the model does *generation.*

The core design philosophy in one sentence: *move the expensive work to indexing time so that query time stays cheap.* Embedding two million chunks takes hours and costs maybe a thousand dollars, once. Every query after that is cents. A long-context system, by contrast, pays an expensive cost on every single query — and the arithmetic of that, at scale, is what we are about to derive.

Three things the architecture commits to, and you should name them before you build.

It commits to an *external belief store.* The agent's knowledge of the corpus does not live in the model anymore. It lives in a vector database that you operate, scale, monitor, and secure. That is infrastructure you did not have before. It has its own failure modes — index corruption, stale embeddings, keyword-match gaps — that you now have to know how to diagnose.

It commits to *retrieval as a potential point of failure.* The model can only reason over what retrieval gives it. If retrieval misses the relevant chunk, the model has no way to recover. The generation step can produce a fluent, confident answer grounded in partial or irrelevant retrieved context, and the output will look correct to anyone who does not already know the right answer. This is the failure mode I lose the most sleep over.

And it commits to a *two-temporal-scale system.* Indexing happens at one cadence — hours, days, occasionally real-time. Querying happens at another — milliseconds to seconds. The gap between them is where staleness lives. Any belief in your corpus that changed after the last re-index is wrong in your retrieval layer until the next re-index catches it.

A misconception worth killing now. *RAG is just semantic search with an LLM on top.* This is the marketing version. It is wrong in a specific way that matters. Semantic search returns a ranked list of documents; RAG returns an *answer conditioned on those documents.* The reasoning layer is load-bearing. Semantic search fails by returning the wrong documents. RAG fails by generating a confident wrong answer when retrieval returns the wrong documents. The second is worse, because the user sees an authoritative statement instead of a ranked list they can evaluate.

## The Tier Selection Procedure

Before you read further, do one calculation. Estimate the word count of your corpus. Multiply by 0.75. Compare the result to the context window of the model you are using. If it fits, you may not need to read further.

**Step 1 — The Token Check (30 seconds)**

```python
# Step 1: Token Check
token_estimate = int(word_count * 0.75)
context_window = 200_000  # your model's actual window

if token_estimate < context_window:
    print("Fits. Tier 1 recommended. Stop here.")
else:
    print("Does not fit. Escalation Trigger fires. Go to Step 2.")

# Startup docs: 63K < 100K -> Tier 1. Sprint cancelled in 60 seconds.
# Grad students: 240K > 200K -> escalate.
```

*Code 1 — The token check the graduate students never ran.*

**Step 2 — Update Frequency:** Real-time updates eliminate Tier 1 and Tier 3. Tier 2 handles live data natively.

**Step 3 — Query Type:** Lookup queries eliminate Tier 3. Cosine similarity is the wrong operation for deterministic lookups. SQL is correct.

**Step 4 — Latency:** Hard budget constraints can eliminate Tier 1 even when the corpus fits. A 200K-token call takes 10–30 seconds. If your budget is 500ms: hard elimination.

<!-- → [TABLE: Tier selection decision matrix — rows: the four variables (Corpus Size C, Query Volume Q, Update Frequency U, Query Type T); columns: Tier 1 Long-Context, Tier 2 MCP Tools, Tier 3 Full RAG; cells show the value of each variable that favors or eliminates each tier; student should be able to run the procedure from the table alone] -->

> **HUMAN DECISION NODE —** During the development of this chapter, the AI scaffold proposed splitting the four decision variables across two separate sections: a clean three-tier ladder followed by a complications section. I rejected this structure. A student applying the procedure to a real system cannot reconstruct a decision algorithm from a narrative split across two sections. The procedure must appear as a single sequential artifact with a named early exit (the Escalation Trigger) and a mandatory stop (the Human Decision Node). The AI proposed structure would have taught the ladder. My revised structure teaches the procedure. That distinction is the chapter's primary pedagogical claim.

---

## The Three-Tier Ladder

**Tier 1: Large Context Window** — put the entire corpus in the prompt. Retrieval error rate is zero because there is no retrieval. The model synthesizes, compares, and qualifies across the entire corpus.

**Tier 2: MCP Tool Functions** — give the agent tools and let it call them at runtime. Best for live data and lookup queries with queryable schemas.

**Tier 3: Full RAG Pipeline** — chunk, embed, index, retrieve. Most powerful for large unstructured corpora. Also the most fragile.

<!-- → [INFOGRAPHIC: Three-tier ladder — vertical stack with Tier 1 at top (simplest, loudest failure), Tier 3 at bottom (most complex, quietest failure); arrows show escalation path with the four variables annotated at each transition; failure mode type labeled at each tier: Tier 1 "HTTP 413 — loud", Tier 2 "semantic drift — medium", Tier 3 "HTTP 200 wrong answer — silent"] -->

> The three-tier ordering is not arbitrary. It follows from the asymmetry in failure modes: Tier 1 produces loud failures — context overflow triggers an API error, HTTP 413, execution stops immediately. Tier 3 produces silent failures — wrong chunk returned, HTTP 200, confident wrong answer, no error signal. Every time you choose Tier 3 for a problem Tier 1 can solve, you are not choosing a more sophisticated architecture. You are trading a detectable failure for an undetectable one. The ladder exists because the failure mode hierarchy is fixed: loud failures are always preferable to silent ones. Start at the tier with the loudest failure mode and escalate only when a hard constraint forces you to accept a quieter one.

## Why Long-Context Gets Expensive

You cannot evaluate the trade-off without understanding the other side. Long-context models look like the elegant solution: one API call, no infrastructure, the model sees everything. The physics of the transformer makes them expensive in a specific, derivable way.

Recall what attention does. For every token in the context, attention computes a score against every other token in the context — how much should this token attend to each of the others? If the context has length $n$, attention requires computing an $n \times n$ matrix of attention scores.

The computational cost is therefore $O(n^2)$ in both time and memory. Not linear. Quadratic.

Concretely: doubling the context from 4,000 tokens to 8,000 does not double the cost. It quadruples it. Going from 8,000 to one million tokens is not a 125-fold increase — it is $125^2$, or 15,625-fold, for a single query.

Modern long-context implementations bend this curve with optimizations — FlashAttention, sliding-window attention, KV-cache reuse. They *bend* the curve. They do not break it. The fundamental scaling is still bad, and the per-query cost is still dominated by the size of the context you load.

Now make the economics concrete. Imagine a legal firm with 50,000 court opinions averaging 10,000 tokens each — 500 million tokens total. The firm fields 10,000 queries per day. At current Claude Opus pricing — fifteen dollars per million input tokens, seventy-five dollars per million output tokens — what does each architecture cost?

The RAG query is straightforward. The system processes 5,500 input tokens (system prompt plus retrieved chunks plus user query) plus 300 output tokens. That comes to about eleven cents per query, plus a fraction of a cent in retrieval overhead. Call it eleven cents.

Now the long-context query. Five hundred million input tokens at fifteen dollars per million is seventy-five hundred dollars. Per query.

At 10,000 queries per day:

RAG costs $1,100 per day, about $400,000 per year. Long-context costs $75 million per day, about *twenty-seven billion dollars per year.*

The long-context version is not a business. It is a joke.

Some of you will already be objecting: prompt caching. Modern providers offer cached prompts at roughly ten percent of the uncached rate after the first load. Fold that in. The cached long-context query still processes 500 million tokens — but at $1.50 per million instead of $15. That is $750 per query, $7.5 million per day, $2.7 billion per year.

Better. Still absurd. The problem is not the unit price. It is the architecture.

<!-- → [CHART: Log-scale cost comparison — x-axis: corpus size in tokens (10K to 1B); y-axis: daily cost in dollars at 10,000 queries/day; three curves: RAG (near-flat), Long-Context uncached (steep quadratic), Long-Context cached (intermediate); student should see the crossover point where long-context becomes economically untenable, and how caching shifts but does not eliminate it] -->

The misconception this kills is the one I hear most often at conferences. *Better models and prompt caching will obsolete RAG within two years.* Walk through what the claim would have to mean. Prompt caching reduces the cost multiplier; it does not change the scaling. A one percent cached rate would turn it into $270 million, which is still the wrong answer for most enterprises. And caching only helps when the same corpus is queried repeatedly — if the corpus is updating hourly, cache hits collapse and you are paying uncached rates. *Better models* means better reasoning per token of context, not better cost scaling. A smarter model reading 500 million tokens still processes 500 million tokens. The quadratic does not care how smart the model is.

## Why Chunking Destroys What You Think It Preserves

The assumption embedded in chunking: meaning is locally concentrated. A 512-token window is semantically self-contained. That assumption is often false. A methods section spans four paragraphs forming a single semantic unit. A chunk boundary between paragraphs two and three creates two incomplete fragments.

<!-- → [IMAGE: Chunk boundary failure illustration — a four-paragraph methods section shown as continuous text; a vertical cut line placed between paragraphs two and three; left fragment labeled "Chunk A — incomplete context"; right fragment labeled "Chunk B — incomplete context"; dotted bracket spans all four paragraphs labeled "actual semantic unit: ~450 tokens"; student should see why chunk_words=200 at a 450-token semantic unit produces 0.44 completeness ratio] -->

> The failure follows a fixed six-step sequence. (1) The document is divided into fixed-size chunks — a design decision made before any query is seen. (2) Each chunk is compressed into an embedding vector encoding statistical co-occurrence patterns in the embedding model's training data. (3) At query time, cosine similarity selects the chunk whose vector direction is closest to the query vector — measuring vocabulary overlap, not semantic relevance for this specific task. (4) The selected chunk is assembled into the model's context window as if it were the complete relevant passage. (5) The model generates a confident answer from incomplete information. (6) The system returns HTTP 200. The failure is complete by Step 3. Steps 4 through 6 propagate it silently. This is not a model failure — the model answered correctly from what it was given. It is an architectural failure: the design decision in Step 1 made Step 3 unreliable, and nothing in Steps 4 through 6 can detect or correct that.

```python
def chunk_corpus(corpus, chunk_words=60, overlap=15):
    # chunk_words=60 (~200 tokens) — deliberately too small.
    # Semantic unit in lab reports: ~450 tokens.
    # Ratio: 200/450 = 0.44. Target: near 1.0. Failure is structural.
    # overlap=15 words: sentence continuity only, NOT semantic continuity.
    for doc in corpus:
        words, start = doc["content"].split(), 0
        while start < len(words):
            end = min(start + chunk_words, len(words))
            yield {"doc_id": doc["id"],
                   "content": " ".join(words[start:end])}
            start += chunk_words - overlap
```

*Code 2 — Chunking function. Every design decision is a potential failure mode.*

```python
def retrieve_top_k(query, chunks, vectorizer, vectors, top_k=3):
    # THE FAILURE LIVES HERE:
    # cos(query, chunk_i) measures vocabulary co-occurrence direction,
    # NOT semantic relevance. Chunks from different protocol years
    # with identical vocabulary score nearly the same.
    scores = cosine_similarity(vectorizer.transform([query]).toarray(), vectors)[0]
    top_idx = np.argsort(scores)[::-1][:top_k]
    # No exception raised. Wrong chunk selected silently. HTTP 200.
    return [chunks[i] for i in top_idx]
```

*Code 3 — Cosine similarity retrieval. The comment marks where the wrong chunk is selected.*

The ratio principle: chunk size / semantic unit size → target near 1.0. Measure first, then chunk.

## Failure Modes Across All Three Tiers

One question routes every failure: *Was the information needed to answer correctly present in what the system actually saw?*

- **Yes** → reasoning failure. The chunk arrived; the model failed to use it correctly.
- **No** → retrieval failure. The relevant passage never reached the model.

<!-- → [TABLE: Failure mode taxonomy — three rows (Tier 1 Long-Context, Tier 2 MCP Tools, Tier 3 Full RAG); four columns (failure name, trigger condition, detection signal, diagnosis approach); student should be able to identify which tier produced a given failure from its observable symptoms] -->

**Tier 1 — Context Dilution:** asymmetric degradation — synthesis queries fail while lookup queries hold. Isolate the corpus before changing tiers.

**Tier 2 — Semantic Drift:** syntactically valid tool call, subtly wrong question. In the 2024 legal discovery case, "discussed settlement authority" as keywords missed all deliberative communications using indirect language. Undetected three weeks.

**Tier 3 — Wrong Chunk.** Build the evaluation first:

```python
# Build evaluation BEFORE the pipeline.
EVAL = [
    {"query": "Current centrifuge speed?",
     "relevant": "GM-2023-007", "keywords": ["6,200", "current"]},
    {"query": "Which versions used PBS buffer?",
     "relevant": "GM-2022-003", "keywords": ["3,200", "4,500", "pbs"]},
    # 3 more: synthesis, lookup, contradiction
]

recall   = hits_where_relevant_in_top_k / total
accuracy = hits_where_keywords_in_context / total

# recall >> accuracy  -> reasoning failure (chunks incomplete)
# both low, small gap -> retrieval failure (wrong chunks)
# accuracy > recall   -> evaluation set bias (easy queries only)
```

*Code 4 — Evaluation pattern. This notebook: recall=0.60, accuracy=0.80 = evaluation set bias.*

---

## The Failure That Looks Like Success

A model given a wrong chunk produces a confident wrong answer with the same surface characteristics as a correct answer. Unlike a programming error, a retrieval error does not crash. It returns HTTP 200 and a string.

```python
# LOUD failure: db.query() -> ConnectionError -> HTTP 500 -> developer fixes it

# SILENT failure (RAG):
# retrieve_top_k() -> [wrong_chunk]          # no exception
# model.generate(wrong_chunk) -> wrong_answer # no exception
# response.status_code -> 200                 # looks successful
# detection: None until human reviewer checks source document

# Only difference between correct and wrong run:
# Correct: chunk["doc_id"] == "GM-2023-007"  score: 0.81
# Wrong:   chunk["doc_id"] == "GM-2022-003"  score: 0.83
# A 0.02 cosine difference. Invisible above Layer 3.
```

*Code 5 — Silent failure anatomy. The 0.02 score difference is the entire causal chain.*

---

## Four Variables

You now know how both architectures work. The remaining question is which to choose for a given deployment, and the answer is a function of four variables. Name them, measure them, and the decision falls out.

*Corpus size* — call it $C$ — is the total text the system needs access to, in tokens. If you do not know this number, stop and measure it. Every downstream decision hinges on it.

*Query volume* — call it $Q$ — is queries per day. It determines whether per-query or per-corpus cost dominates. A thousandfold difference in $Q$ can flip the architecture choice even when $C$ is constant.

*Update frequency* — call it $U$ — is how often the corpus changes. Daily, weekly, monthly, never. $U$ governs whether caching helps and how much operational complexity the freshness requirement forces.

*Query type* — call it $T$ — is whether queries are *local*, answerable from a small subset of the corpus, or *global*, requiring synthesis across the whole corpus. Local queries are RAG's strength; global queries are its weakness.

Here is the decision flow. Work through the rules in order. The first rule that applies is your answer.

If $C$ fits in the context window and $U$ is low, long-context is almost always right — architecture simpler, latency acceptable, cost manageable. If $C$ is much larger than the context window, you need RAG for initial retrieval; no choice. If $Q$ is very high and queries are local, RAG wins on cost even when long-context is technically feasible. If queries are global, you may need a hybrid: RAG retrieves a relevant section, long-context processes that section as a coherent unit. If $U$ is high, RAG has a significant operational advantage — you are updating vectors, not reloading and re-caching million-token contexts.

<!-- → [INFOGRAPHIC: Four-variable decision flowchart — rectangular decision nodes for C, Q, U, T in sequence; branching paths with labeled conditions; terminal nodes labeled Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, or Hybrid; student should be able to trace any of the three case-study deployments to its verdict using this diagram alone] -->

---

## Three Deployments, Three Verdicts

To exercise the framework, walk through three deployments that resolve in three different directions.

The first is a SaaS customer-support bot. Two million tokens of help articles. Fifty thousand queries per day. Daily updates as the docs change. Queries that are mostly local — most are answerable from one to three articles.

Walk through the flow. Long-context fails: even where two million tokens fits, daily $U$ kills caching. RAG is needed: high $Q$ plus local queries is exactly RAG's sweet spot. Daily updates favor RAG's incremental indexing model. Every variable points the same direction. *Verdict: pure RAG.* This is the deployment RAG was designed for.

The second is a legal-memo drafting tool over a single 150-page case file. Two hundred thousand tokens. Twenty queries per day from associates working the case. Weekly updates as new filings come in. Queries that are global — they require reasoning across the whole case.

Walk through. The corpus fits, $U$ is low, global queries need long-context. Low $Q$ means per-query cost is bearable; weekly $U$ means prompt caching pays for itself across many queries. *Verdict: long-context, with prompt caching.* The associates do not need a vector database. They need the model to see the whole case. This is where teams that default to RAG waste months of engineering time.

The third is an enterprise knowledge assistant. Five hundred million tokens of internal documents. Five thousand queries per day. Hourly updates because it is an active knowledge base. Queries that are mixed — some local, some requiring synthesis.

Walk through. The corpus is far beyond any context window, so RAG is forced at some level. But global queries need long-context, also at some level. Both rules apply to different parts of the same deployment. *Verdict: hybrid.* RAG retrieves a relevant cluster of chunks — maybe fifty chunks totaling 25,000 tokens — and long-context processes that cluster as a coherent window for synthesis.

<!-- → [TABLE: Three-deployment verdict summary — rows: SaaS support bot, legal memo tool, enterprise knowledge assistant; columns: C (tokens), Q (queries/day), U (update cadence), T (query type), verdict, reason in one sentence; student should be able to reproduce the verdict for each row from the four variables alone] -->

A misconception this exercise should kill: *RAG is the default.* It is not. It is the right default for high-volume, large-corpus, local-query deployments — which happens to describe many commercial AI products, which is why the default became folk wisdom. Outside that regime, defaulting to RAG wastes months of engineering time and loses answer quality. For a team with a 200,000-token product spec and twenty internal users, the right first build is a long-context API call. Ship that, measure, and add RAG only if the numbers say to.

## The AI Scaffold and the Human Decision Node

The AI Scaffold proposes tier candidates, flags its own assumptions, then halts. It cannot finalize the architecture — it does not know your query distribution, corpus semantic structure, or tolerance for silent failure. You do.

```python
# AI SCAFFOLD — proposes candidates, flags assumptions, HALTS.
tokens = int(word_count * 0.75)

if tokens < 200_000:
    print(f"[VIABLE] Tier 1 — {tokens:,} tokens fits 200K window")
    print("  AI ASSUMPTION: model has 200K window — VERIFY THIS")

print("=" * 50)
print("SCAFFOLD HALTED — HUMAN DECISION NODE REQUIRED")
print("Complete the Tier Selection Brief before proceeding.")
# The scaffold does not finalize. You do.
```

*Code 6 — Mandatory HALT. The scaffold enumerates candidates and flags its own assumptions.*

---

## Why This Architecture, Not Another

Step back. Why did the field converge on this architecture instead of some alternative?

The deep answer is that the field optimized for a specific trade-off: *separate the knowledge from the reasoning.* RAG treats the language model as a reasoning engine that queries an external, dynamic knowledge base. It parallels how human cognition works — we do not memorize every fact; we know how to look things up and then reason about what we find.

The alternative — bake all knowledge into the model's weights — was tried. It is called *fine-tuning on your documents*, and it mostly does not work for knowledge retrieval. The model learns the *style* of your documents but not reliable access to their *facts.* It hallucinates. The field learned, expensively, that pretrained weights are for reasoning and external stores are for facts.

This is what I mean when I say the design philosophy reveals what the field values. RAG embodies the bet that reasoning and knowledge should be decoupled. Long-context embodies the opposite bet — that if you just make the context big enough, the distinction stops mattering. The current state of the art suggests the first bet was mostly right, with the second reserved for specific use cases.

The choice of where to put memory is the choice of what kind of system you are building. The model is increasingly a commodity. *The memory is the product.* Everything interesting that happens next in agent design happens in this layer.

Before you reach for RAG, measure your four variables. Before you reach for long-context, do the cost calculation. The architecture is not a default. It is a bet, and the bet has a regime.

*(Tests: Six Stages architecture overview)*
*Difficulty: Low*

**3.** A team is getting HTTP 200 responses but noticing wrong answers in about 20% of queries. A colleague says, "The model must be hallucinating."

### Application

**4.** A news aggregation service has 800 million tokens of archived articles and handles 200,000 queries per day. Articles are added hourly. Most queries ask about specific recent events (local queries). Using the Four Variables framework, work through each variable in order and name the recommended tier. Show your reasoning at each step.
*(Tests: Four Variables decision procedure)*
*Difficulty: Medium*

**5.** You are reviewing a colleague's chunking function. They have set `chunk_words=100` for a corpus of academic papers. You sample ten papers and measure that the average semantic unit (a complete argument or methods step) spans approximately 600 tokens. Calculate the completeness ratio and explain what structural failure this ratio predicts. What would you change, and why?
*(Tests: Chunking — ratio principle and semantic unit measurement)*
*Difficulty: Medium*

**6.** A legal discovery tool uses Tier 2 MCP tool functions to search a structured case database. Attorneys report that queries like "find all emails where settlement authority was discussed" are returning incomplete results. Name the failure mode, explain its mechanism as described in the chapter, and propose one concrete change to the query formulation strategy to reduce it.
*(Tests: Tier 2 Semantic Drift failure mode)*
*Difficulty: Medium*

**7.** Using the cost calculation method from the chapter, estimate the daily cost difference between a pure RAG architecture and an uncached long-context architecture for a corpus of 50 million tokens queried 5,000 times per day. Use the pricing figures given in the chapter. Explain why prompt caching does not resolve the fundamental problem.
*(Tests: Why Long-Context Gets Expensive — $O(n^2)$ scaling and cost arithmetic)*
*Difficulty: Medium*

### Synthesis

**8.** A research institution has a 300-million-token corpus of scientific papers. They field 500 queries per day, mostly synthesis queries ("how have methods for X evolved across papers from 2018–2024?"). Updates happen monthly. Walk through the Four Variables procedure. Explain why the verdict is Hybrid rather than pure RAG, and describe what each tier in the hybrid handles.
*(Tests: Four Variables procedure + Hybrid architecture rationale + global vs. local query type)*
*Difficulty: High*

**9.** The chapter argues that the three-tier ladder is ordered by failure mode severity, not by architectural sophistication. Using the failure modes for all three tiers, construct the argument the chapter makes: why is it rational to prefer a less capable tier if it produces louder failures? Under what conditions would a practitioner rationally override this preference and accept a silent failure mode?
*(Tests: Three-Tier Ladder rationale + Failure That Looks Like Success + Human Decision Node)*
*Difficulty: High*

**10.** The chapter's Human Decision Node sidebar describes a rejected AI scaffold proposal. Reconstruct why the AI's proposed structure (ladder section + complications section) would have produced worse outcomes for a student applying the procedure to a real system. Then generalize: what principle about procedural knowledge explains the difference between "teaching the ladder" and "teaching the procedure"?
*(Tests: Human Decision Node + Tier Selection Procedure + design philosophy of the chapter itself)*
*Difficulty: High*

---

### Challenge

**11.** The chapter states: "The model is increasingly a commodity. The memory is the product." Construct an argument that challenges this claim. Under what conditions does the opposite hold — where the reasoning layer, not the memory layer, is the primary source of differentiation? Use at least two of the chapter's case studies or deployment scenarios as evidence.
*(Tests: Why This Architecture, Not Another — stress-tests the chapter's central design philosophy claim)*
*Difficulty: Very High*

**12.** Design an evaluation suite for a RAG system over a 50-document technical corpus. Your suite must distinguish between retrieval failures and reasoning failures, detect evaluation set bias (recall > accuracy pattern), and include at least one query designed to surface chunk boundary failures. For each evaluation query, specify: the query text, the relevant document ID, the keywords that should appear in a correct answer, and what a specific failure pattern in the metrics would tell you about the architecture.
*(Tests: Evaluation pattern from Code 4 + Failure Modes + Chunking failure mechanism — requires integrating the full chapter)*
*Difficulty: Very High*
